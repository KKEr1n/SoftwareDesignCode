# Software Design Code
Code samples based on the Software Design textbook.

This was derived from the original repo (@prmr) to add
- gradle integration. Import this project in your IDE using gradle, or just use gradle on the command line
- Java 11/JFX 11 support
- remove Eclipse integration (in favour of Gradle)
